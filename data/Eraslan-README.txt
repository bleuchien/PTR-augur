#### Table EV3 ####

Tissue specific mRNA (median across replicates, FPKM-log10), protein (iBAQ-log10) measurements and protein-to-mRNA ratios (log10) of 11,575 transcripts considered in the study. Values that are 0 in natural scale, and FPKM values smaller than 1 in log10 scale are encoded as missing values (NA).
